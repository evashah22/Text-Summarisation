# Text-Summarisation
This repository contains code for a text summarization system.

Introduction

Text summarization automatically condenses lengthy documents into shorter versions that capture the key points. This project implements a (choose one or both: extractive/abstractive) summarization approach to:

Improve information access by making it easier to grasp the main ideas of long texts.
Save time by quickly understanding the content of documents.

Further Exploration

Experiment with different text files and adjust the summary length.
Explore different summarization techniques (if the code supports them).
Visualize the key points identified in the summary.
